# WARNING! This code makes an SSL connection to the Nexpose server, but does NOT
#          verify the certificate at this time. This can be a security issue if
#          an attacker is able to man-in-the-middle the connection between the
#          Metasploit console and the Nexpose server. In the common case of
#          running Nexpose and Metasploit on the same host, this is a low risk.
#

#
# WARNING! This code is still rough and going through substantive changes. While
#          you can build tools using this library today, keep in mind that
#          method names and parameters may change in the future.
